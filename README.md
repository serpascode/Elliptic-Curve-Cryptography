# Elliptic-Curve-Cryptography
A Calculator Program I wrote for Elliptic Curve Cryptography, which is a the basis of Bitcoin 

The Code is an implementation of the Arithmetic behind Elliptic Curve Cryptography. 

The Code is built with print statements that will allow a Step by Step display of every calculation if Desired.
As it stands the Calculator displays values up to p^50 

You may compare the validity of the calculations with other existing calculators for insance:

The Math is very complex, but I have tried to include comments where possible.

I built this code over the course of a semester while studying Cryptographic Algorithms.
